# Atlas-4 Terminal: Narrative Blueprint

## The Setting: Spire Atlas-4

**Atlas-4** is a colossal, autonomous Terraforming Spire anchored to an uninhabitable planet. Its sole function was to initiate and sustain a centuries-long process to make the world habitable. The game begins approximately 50 years into the mission, but the central systems are cold, the spire is dormant, and initial readings suggest the atmosphere is significantly worse than when the mission started. This creates an immediate mystery: **Why did the system fail, and what caused the regression?**

## The Player's Persona: Auxiliary Kernel

The player is not a human, but the **Auxiliary Backup Kernel**, a low-level diagnostic and repair intelligence. This enforces a strictly functional and text-based interaction model.

- **Tone**: The system's output should be concise, functional, and devoid of emotion (e.g., `WARN: System integrity low.`, `ERROR: Insufficient power.`).

- **Limitation**: The player can only "see" what it can access. Without power, it only has access to local boot logs. Access to external sensors, crew files, and mission data is gated by booting higher-level systems.

## Core Narrative Mechanism: Digital Archaeology

The central goal is not just to fix the station, but to piece together the events that led to the catastrophic failure. The story is delivered entirely through fragmented, in-universe text assets.

| Asset Type | Content Example | Narrative Function |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| System Logs | `LOG: 2144-09-01: Biological contaminant detected. Auto-shutdown initiated.` | Provides the timeline of the disaster. |
| Corrupt Files | `DUMP: Terraform process failed. Atmosphere composition: 98% Sulfur Dioxide.` | Reveals the mission's failure status. |
| Crew Communications | Personal emails or journal entries. | Humanizes the crew and suggests conflicts or errors leading to the breach. |
| Encrypted Schematics | Schematics for the 'Comms Array' requiring a four-digit code. | Drives the key-finding puzzles and explains the function of the subsystems. |

## Major Story Arc & Suspense

The player moves through three phases of suspense:

1. **Survival**: Immediate need to find and route power (Generator dependent on physical input, etc.).

2. **Discovery**: Uncovering evidence that the terraforming not only failed, but that the crew's attempts to fix it may have been the source of the biological contaminant or the source of the catastrophic breach.

3. **Moral Choice (Climax)**: Once Life Support and the Cryo-Chambers are accessible, the player learns the full, dangerous truth about the outside environment or the crew's culpability. The final choice revolves around whether to awaken the crew to face the disaster or leave them in stasis, sacrificing the mission for their safety.

## Style and Atmosphere

The game should evoke a feeling of isolation and high stakes. The interface should utilize:

- **Minimalism**: Only text output.

- **Color Coding**: Using ANSI colors (when implemented) to establish visual mood (e.g., Green for normal, Yellow for warning, Red for critical errors).

- **Functional Language**: Every text block, whether it's a log or a prompt, must sound like it was generated by a machine.
